## 📖 Book Recommendation: *The House of Doors* by Tan Twan Eng

### ✨ Why This Book Matters

Set in colonial Penang in the 1920s, *The House of Doors* is a richly layered novel exploring memory, secrets, and storytelling. It delves into the intersections of race, gender, and power during a time when women’s lives were deeply constrained by patriarchy and imperialism.

The novel features a fictionalized version of author W. Somerset Maugham, alongside strong female voices like Lesley Hamlyn - a woman who dares to tell her truth. Through her, Tan Twan Eng explores what it means for women to *speak*, to *withhold*, and to *rise* through their stories.
